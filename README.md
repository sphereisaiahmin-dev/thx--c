## MIDI clock + arpeggiator
- In your DAW, enable MIDI clock output to the device (typically in the MIDI/Sync or external clock settings for the output port connected to the Pico).
- Toggle the arpeggiator by pressing the **3** key (top row, fourth from the left) and **F** key (bottom row, fourth from the left) at the same time; each simultaneous press flips the arpeggiator on/off.
